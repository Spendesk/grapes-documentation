# Elevation

## Tokens

<ElevationTokens />

## Usage in CSS

Whenever you want to apply this style, you can use the corresponding token.

```css
.myClass {
  box-shadow: var(--elevation-xs);
}
```

## Usage with TailwindCSS

Whenever you want to use an elevation from Grapes with TailwindCSS, you can use the corresponding className.

<ElevationTailwind />

See documentation from TailwindCSS: [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/box-shadow](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/box-shadow).

:::info{title="elevation-XX is an alias for shadow-XX from tailwindcss. You can use both elevation-XX or shadow-XX"}
Please note that elevation-XX doesn't compose gracefully with ring-X
utilities. If you need to use ring-X with an elevation, it's recommended to
use shadow-XX instead.
