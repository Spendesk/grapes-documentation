# Colors

Each color is displayed in both light and dark themes. The color on the left represents the light theme, while the one on the right corresponds to the dark theme.

For a given design token, the color theme is automatically determined by your application's color scheme. Grapes uses the `light-dark` function for this.
If this function is not supported, Grapes will fallback to the light scheme automatically.

<ColorTokens />

## Usage in CSS

  color: var(--grapes-color-content-primary);
}
```
