import { MdxLayout } from "@/components/layout/layout";
import { Callout } from "@/components/callout/callout";

import { ElevationTailwind } from "./elevation-tailwind";

export const metadata = {
  title: "Elevation",
};

export default ({ children }) => (
  <MdxLayout metadata={metadata}>{children}</MdxLayout>
);

## Tokens

<ElevationTokens />

## Usage in CSS

Whenever you want to apply this style, you can use the corresponding token.

```css
.myClass {
  box-shadow: var(--elevation-10);
}
```

## Usage with TailwindCSS

Whenever you want to use an elevation from Grapes with TailwindCSS, you can use the corresponding className.

<ElevationTailwind />

<Callout
  className="mt-s"
  title="elevation-XX is an alias for shadow-XX from tailwindcss. You can use both elevation-XX or shadow-XX"
  variant="info"
>
  Please note that elevation-XX doesn't compose gracefully with ring-X
  utilities. If you need to use ring-X with an elevation, it's recommended to
  use shadow-XX instead.
</Callout>
