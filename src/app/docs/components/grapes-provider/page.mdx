# GrapesProvider

GrapesProvider is the container for all Grapes applications. It defines the locale, and other application level settings such as mapboxAccessToken for the AutocompletePlace.

A GrapesProvider must be the root component of your application. Many Grapes components rely on the GrapesProvider to define the locale, and other settings that they need in order to render.
