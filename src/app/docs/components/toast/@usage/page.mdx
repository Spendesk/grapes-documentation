import { Toast } from "@dev-spendesk/grapes";
import { Preview } from "@/components/preview/preview";

## Basic usage

<Preview className="pointer-events-none [&>*]:animate-none">
  <Toast title="Your receipt has been uploaded" canExpire variant="success" />
</Preview>

```tsx
<Toast title="Your receipt has been uploaded" onClose={() => closeToast()} />
```

## Variant

The Toast comes with two visual styles: success (default) and alert.

<Preview className="pointer-events-none [&>*]:animate-none">
  <Toast title="Your receipt has been uploaded" canExpire variant="success" />
  <Toast title="Your receipt has been uploaded" canExpire variant="alert" />
</Preview>

```tsx
<Toast
  title="Your receipt has been uploaded"
  variant="success"
  onClose={() => closeToast()}
/>
<Toast
  title="Your receipt has been uploaded"
  variant="alert"
  onClose={() => closeToast()}
/>
```

## Content

Use the `children` prop to add any content to the Toast.

<Preview className="pointer-events-none [&>*]:animate-none">
  <Toast title="Your receipt has been uploaded" canExpire variant="success">
    Description (optional)
  </Toast>
</Preview>

```tsx
<Toast title="Your receipt has been uploaded" onClose={() => closeToast()}>
  Description (optional)
</Toast>
```

## Action

Use the `action` prop to add a button (action) to your Toast. Only **one** action is supported.

<Preview className="pointer-events-none [&>*]:animate-none">
  <Toast
    title="Your receipt has been uploaded"
    action={{
      text: "Action",
    }}
  />
</Preview>

```tsx
<Toast
  title="Your receipt has been uploaded"
  onClose={() => closeToast()}
  action={{
    text: "Action",
    onClick: () => {},
  }}
/>
```

## Sticky

Setting the `canExpire` prop to false will make the Toast component stay on the page. No timer will be shown to be user.

<Preview className="pointer-events-none [&>*]:animate-none">
  <Toast title="Your receipt has been uploaded" canExpire={false} />
</Preview>

```tsx
<Toast
  title="Your receipt has been uploaded"
  onClose={() => closeToast()}
  canExpire={false}
/>
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the `status` [role requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#status).

The Toast component uses the element `output` by default with inplicits `aria-live="polite"` and `aria-atomic="true"` attributes. Add those to change the default values.
