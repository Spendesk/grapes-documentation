);

/>
```

## Usage

### Variant

<div className="box flex flex-col gap-m pointer-events-none">
  <Toast title="Your receipt has been uploaded" canExpire variant="success" />
  <Toast title="Your receipt has been uploaded" canExpire variant="alert" />
</div>

```tsx
<Toast title="Your receipt has been uploaded" canExpire variant="success" />
<Toast title="Your receipt has been uploaded" canExpire variant="alert" />
```

### With description

<div className="box pointer-events-none">
  <Toast title="Your receipt has been uploaded" canExpire variant="success">
    Description (optional)
  </Toast>
</div>

```tsx
<Toast title="Your receipt has been uploaded" canExpire variant="success">
  Description (optional)
</Toast>
```

### With action

<div className="box pointer-events-none">
  <Toast
    title="Your receipt has been uploaded"
    canExpire
    variant="success"
    action={{
      text: "Action",
    }}
  />
</div>

```tsx
<Toast
  title="Your receipt has been uploaded"
  canExpire
  variant="success"
  action={{
    text: "Action",
  }}
/>
```

### Sticky

Setting the `canExpire` prop to false will make the Toast component stay on the page.

<div className="box pointer-events-none">
  <Toast
    title="Your receipt has been uploaded"
    canExpire={false}
    variant="success"
  />
</div>

```tsx
<Toast
  title="Your receipt has been uploaded"
  canExpire={false}
  variant="success"
/>
```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the `status` [role requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#status).

The Toast component uses the element `output` by default with inplicits `aria-live="polite"` and `aria-atomic="true"` attributes. Add those to change the default values.
