import { Preview } from "@/components/preview/preview";
import { DemoSideNavigation } from "./demo";

## Import

- `SideNavigation`: The navigation component.
- `NavigationItem`: A helper component designed to represent an item inside a navigation list.

---

## Basic usage

The side navigation presents a list of navigation items on the side to help the user navigate between pages. Please refer to the [NavigationItem](/docs/components/navigation-item) docs for more information on how to create the different links (emphasized, with divider, with icon, etc.).

<Preview>
  <DemoSideNavigation />
</Preview>

```tsx
const accountingNavigation = [
  {
    label: "Accounting integration",
    key: "accounting-integration",
  },
  ...
];

export function MySideNavigation() {
  const [activeKey, setActiveKey] = useState("accounting-integration");

  return (
    <SideNavigation>
      {accountingNavigation.map((book) => (
        <NavigationItem
          key={book.key}
          text={book.label}
          isActive={book.key === activeKey}
          isEmphasized={[
            "accounting-integration",
            "bank-accounts",
            "expense-accounts",
          ].includes(book.key)}
          onClick={() => setActiveKey(book.key)}
        />
      ))}
    </SideNavigation>
  );
}
```
