## Button position

The Banner leverages [CSS Container queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries) to control the button's positioning.

- If the width of the Banner is **below** 744px, the button will be positioned at the bottom.
- If the width of the banner **equals or exceeds** 744px, the button will be positioned on the right.

There is no way to customize this behavior.
