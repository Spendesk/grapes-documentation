## Variant

The Badge comes with two visual styles: brand (default) and neutral.

<Preview className="grid">
  <Banner
    variant="neutral"
    illustration={<img src="/user-infinite.webp" />}
    title="Neutral variant"
    actions={<Button variant="secondaryNeutral" text="Set up sub-budgets" />}
  >
    You can now track sub-budgets based on expense categories. It will help you
    track your budgets with more granularity and precision.
  </Banner>
  <Banner
    variant="brand"
    illustration={<img src="/user-infinite.webp" />}
    title="Brand variant"
    actions={<Button variant="secondaryNeutral" text="Set up sub-budgets" />}
  >
    You can now track sub-budgets based on expense categories. It will help you
    track your budgets with more granularity and precision.

## Banner without illustration

The `illustration` prop is not mandatory in the Banner component. However, it is strongly advised to add an illustration when space is not a constraint.

<Preview>
  <Banner
    variant="neutral"
    title="Neutral variant"
    actions={<Button variant="secondaryNeutral" text="Set up sub-budgets" />}
  >
    You can now track sub-budgets based on expense categories. It will help you
    track your budgets with more granularity and precision.
  </Banner>
</Preview>

```tsx sandbox

  <Banner
    variant="neutral"
    title="Neutral variant"
    actions={<Button variant="secondaryNeutral" text="Set up sub-budgets" />}
