# Autocomplete

The autocomplete is a text input enhanced by a list of suggested options. This component is useful when the user has to choose a single option from a predefined list.

This component shouldn't be used in the following scenarios:

- The input may contain multiple options. Please refer to the [AutocompleteMultiple component](/docs/components/autocomplete-multiple).
- The input must be an address. Please refer to the [AutocompletePlace component](/docs/components/autocomplete-place)
