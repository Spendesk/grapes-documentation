Learn how styling works in Grapes, including how you can apply a theme to Grapes.

## Introduction

Grapes is designed to maintain uniformity across all Spendesk applications. Each component comes with pre-defined styles tested to align with Spendesk guidelines and ensure accessibility standards are met.

**Customizing Grapes is discouraged** but our components do provide flexibility
for adjusting layouts, spacing, and other elements to suit your needs.

## CSS Cascade layer

This section assumes that you're already familiar with CSS cascade layers.
Grapes exposes one [CSS cascade layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) named `grapes`.
All styles are contained within this layer.

When you need to overwrite some styles from Grapes, your CSS need be defined either outside of any layer or inside a layer taking precedence over `grapes`.

## className props

All Grapes components should support the props `className`. This props is intended to set styling option such as layout, position, and spacing.
Although not recommended, this props can also be used to override any style within a given component.

<Callout variant="warning" title="Mind the order of your layer">
  If your className is defined in a layer, make sure your layer takes precedence
  over `grapes`.
</Callout>

## Theming

Colors, sizing, spacing, fonts, and other tokens can be customized throught the use of CSS variables. Most predefined CSS variables are defined under the section `Design Token`.

The recommended way to override the Grapes theme is to define a new CSS Cascade layer inside your application, say `marketing`.

```css
@layer marketing {
  // rules
}
```

To override any CSS variable use the pseudo-class `:root` :

```css
@layer marketing {
  :root {
    --color-primary: red;
    --spacing-xxs: 0.8rem;
  }
}
```

To take effect, **your layer should take precedence** over the layer `grapes`:

```css
@layer grapes, marketing;

@layer marketing {
  :root {
    --color-primary: red;
    --spacing-xxs: 0.8rem;
  }
}
```
