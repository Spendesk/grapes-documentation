# Philosophy

Grapes is not a kitchen-sink design-system that attempts to handle every use case your code coud have in the way you wish.
Instead, it serves as the foundation upon which the Spendesk frontend is built.

Yet, Grapes has many components and even more props. While many are essentials, some components and props, such as `BetaDropdownMenuSearch` or the `CollapsibleList` are harder to justifiy. Others, like the `Banner` and the `Callout` have become the subject of [bike-shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) within the team and among Grapes' consumers. .

These components are remnants of the past and have become costly to maintain. Their existence should not serve as a motivation to add more components.

Attempting to support every use case is a perfect example of [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).

In the past, Grapes was focused on growth and supporting as many use cases as possible to increase its adoption within the Spendesk frontend.
However, now that Grapes fully powers the Spendesk frontend, the focus has shift from growth at all costs to stability, consistency, and flexibility.

Going forward, new components and props will only be added if they:

- Do not conflict with existing components
- Can be extended to other use cases

This approach will help maintain a balanced and efficient design system.
