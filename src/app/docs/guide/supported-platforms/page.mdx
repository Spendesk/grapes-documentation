# Supported platforms

## Browser

Grapes supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers.

| Browser          | Version |
| :--------------- | :------ |
| `Edge`           | >= 105  |
| `Chrome`         | >= 105  |
| `Safari (macOS)` | >= 16.5 |
| `Firefox`        | >= 121  |

## React

Grapes supports the most recent versions of React, including React **18.2.0** and React **19**.

## Dual formats ESM/CJS

Grapes ships with support for both [ECMAScript modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) and [CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html).

- **ESM is the preferred choice**, offering benefits such as named exports, improved static analysis, tree-shaking, native browser support, and alignment with the future of JavaScript.
- CommonJS is currently included for legacy support purposes only. Note that CommonJS support is expected to be removed in the future.
