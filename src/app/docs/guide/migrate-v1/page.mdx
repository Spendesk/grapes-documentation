# Migrate from v0 to v1

Grapes v1 is the biggest update of Grapes yet, bringing a major overhaul design. At its heart is a brand new color palette, paired with refreshed design tokens, updated typography, and a new icon set.

But Grapes v1 is not just about looks - it's also about performance and developer experience.
We've streamlined the implementation by eliminating unnecessary props, removing deprecated components, updating our code to more modern syntax and changing our build stack. As a result, Grapes v1 is 15% lighter than Grapes v0.

And with Grapes v1, we're also introducing a new way to incorporate styles into your application. It ensures seamless compatibility with both new and legacy frameworks, giving you the freedom to build using any tool.

## New baseline

In Grapes 1.x, the minimum browser support has been updated. Here is the new baseline:

| Browser          | Version |
| :--------------- | :------ |
| `Edge`           | >= 105  |
| `Chrome`         | >= 105  |
| `Safari (macOS)` | >= 16.5 |
| `Firefox`        | >= 121  |

Grapes 1.x needs the pseudo-class `:has` to work propertly. Please visit [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/css-has) to look at browser support.

## Migration workflow

### Update Grapes version

Install the latest version of Grapes:

```bash
npm install @dev-spendesk/grapes@latest
```

### Run migration scripts with @dev-spendesk/grapes-codemod CLI

`@dev-spendesk/grapes-codemod` is CLI tool containing a collection of codemod scripts that help update Grapes components.
This tool helps you upgrade your codebase to the latest stable versions.

To upgrade to Grapes 1.x, you need to run both CSS codemods and Javascript codemods:

```bash
npx @dev-spendesk/grapes-codemod ui-refresh-migrate "./src/**/*.{ts,js,tsx,jsx}"
npx @dev-spendesk/grapes-codemod css-ui-refresh-migrate "./src/**/*.css"
```

### Include Grapes styles

In Grapes v1, the way styles are shipped has changed. Unlike previous versions where styles were embedded in the JavaScript code, Grapes 1.x requires you to import the style separately.

Inside your main CSS file, include the following line:

```css
@import "@dev-spendesk/grapes/style" layer(grapes);
```

:::info{title="Usage"}
We highly recommend importing styles from Grapes into a layer called Grapes.

### New fonts

Grapes v1 introduces two new fonts, `Roobert` and `Inter`. To use them, you'll need to include the following in your main CSS file:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Roobert";
  font-weight: 500;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
  src: url("path/to/Roobert.woff2") format("woff2");
}

@font-face {
  font-family: "Inter";
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
  font-weight: 1 999;
  src: url("/path/to/Inter.woff2") format("woff2");
}
```
