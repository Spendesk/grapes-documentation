      <p>
        We&apos;re convinced that anyone who uses our products should easily and
        quickly recognize the value of Spendesk while using the platform and be
        delighted by the experience, feeling a sense of accomplishment and
        empowerment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users should have this experience across devices and form factors. They
        should also feel that Spendesk honors the conventions of the device,
        feel native to the country and culture within which it is used.
